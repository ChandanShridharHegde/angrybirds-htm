    <h1>Angry Birds</h1>
    <img  class="abc"src="./images/202301_AB_characters_1920x1080.jpg"height="300"alt="angrybirds">
    <p class="a">Angry Birds has become one of the most successful and iconic franchises in mobile gaming, branching out into various forms of media and entertainment. Created by Rovio Entertainment, the game's addictive gameplay, where players use a slingshot to launch birds at structures inhabited by pigs, resonated globally. Its simple mechanics, humor, and wide appeal led to immense popularity, resulting in spin-offs, merchandise, TV series, and films.

        The films, The Angry Birds Movie (2016) and The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019), expanded the storylines of the game, focusing on the birds' rivalry with the pigs and were well-received by fans of the franchise. With Sega acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the future of the franchise seems bright, as a third film is in production and more expansions of the universe are likely to come.
        
        The game's impact was huge, even beyond mobile gaming, with more than 2 billion downloads by 2014. Its blend of strategy, puzzle-solving, and humor remains a major part of its appeal.

<h2>Characters:</h2>
<ol>
    <div >
    <li>Red</li>
    <img class="abc"src="./images/red.jpg"height="300"alt="red">
    <p class="b">Red is the main character in the Angry Birds franchise. He's a red bird with thick black eyebrows and is known for his grumpy and serious personality. Despite his anger issues, Red is deeply committed to protecting the birds' eggs from the green pigs, who constantly try to steal them.</p>
    
</div>
<hr>
<div >
<li>Chuck</li>
<img class="abc"src="./images/chunk.jpg"height="300"alt="chuck">
<p>Red’s yellow best friend is Chuck, the informal second-in-command of the Angry Birds troupe, and quite possibly the fastest bird in the world. His super-speed abilities to do anything from stopping time, to manifesting miraculous air boosts, makes him an invaluable member of Red’s Flock, and his mischievous nature cements him as a fan favorite too. </p>

</div>
<hr>
<div>
    <li>Bomb </li>
    <img class="abc" src="./images/bomb.jpg"height="300"alt="bomb">
    <p>The most explosive of the Angry Birds, with the least imagination in their name, Bomb is a trusted friend of Red and a consistent member of the team. With his destructive powers, he’s one of the most well-equipped to take down strongholds and fortresses, and his fitting short-fuse attitude makes him even more of a danger to the short-snouted inhabitants of the Piggy Kingdom. </p>
   
</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>Bubbles </li>
    <img class="abc" src="./images/bubbles.jpg"height="300"alt="bubble">
    <p>While not part of the original line-up, the self-inflating Angry Bird Bubbles has been around since Seasons, helping to take down the egg-stealing pig scourge. This bird’s ability is to blow up, as in inflate, rather than explode.</p>
    
</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>Silver </li>
    <img class="abc" src="./images/silver.jpg"height="300"alt="Silver">
    <p>Raised by pigs, Silver starts out as an outcast among the Angry Birds crew, thanks mainly to her acting more like one of the snouted mammals that Red’s flock is striving to take down, but thanks to her can-do attitude and helpful mid-air looping ability, these days she’s an established member of the gang. She’s also undergone a significant number of redesigns over the years. </p>
    
</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>Stella  </li>
    <img class="abc"src="./images/stella.jpg"height="300"alt="Stella">
    <p>Another late-comer, Stella is one of the few Angry Birds members to come from Golden Island rather than Bird Island, but this doesn’t mean she doesn’t give it her all to save the precious eggs. After joining the group when her friend Gale defected to the enemy, Stella has since channeled her vengeance into her special bubble attack that floats debris into the path of the pigs. </p>
</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>Hal </li>
    <img class="abc"src="./images/hal.jpg"height="300"alt="hal">
    <p>Hal, the green boomerang bird, is another welcome member of Red’s flock. He’s also the musician of the Angry Birds gang, often seen with his trusty banjo (when he’s not boomeranging his way through piggy bases, that is). </p>

</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>Matilda </li>
    <img class="abc"src="./images/matilda.jpeg"height="300"alt="Matilda">
    <p>Matilda is the least aggressive of the Angry Birds by far, but that doesn’t make her useless. In fact, Matilda is one of the better weapons against the Piggy Kingdom, with her special ability to lay explosive eggs all over the hideouts standing in her way. She’s also married to Terence, the next bird on our list, and has since become the unofficial matriarch of the group. </p>
</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>Terence</li>
   
    <img class="abc"src="./images/terence.png"height="300"alt="terence">
    <p>As the strongest avian of the core Angry Birds crew, Terence is the last thing an unsuspecting pig wants to see rain down on them. He’s also the archetypal strong but silent type, hardly ever dipping into conversation with Red and the rest of the flock, but he’s shown his heart a few times over the long history of Angry Birds titles. </p>
</div>
<hr>
<div >
    <li>The Blues</li>
    <img class="abc" src="./images/AB2_Blues.webp"height="300"alt="Blues">
    <p>Known collectively as the Blues, Jim, Jake, and Jay are a trio of Angry Birds who attack as one, flying as a collective before releasing into a cluster that hits three different targets. Despite the bags under each of their eyes, the Blues are a lively bunch, adding a good bit of youthful energy to the grumpy Angry Birds gang. </p>
